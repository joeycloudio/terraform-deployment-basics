EXAMPLE END-TO-END TEST USING TF TEST FRAMEWORK

#in terraform you leverage apply command
#below is basic test

# example file is main.tf
-------------------------
variable "repo_name" {
  type = string
  default     = null
}

resource "aws_codecommit_repository" "codecommit" {
  repository_name = var.repo_name #ðŸ‘ˆ the repo name has been assigned as a variable here
}

# then test below to validate functionality
# 1 - will run terraform apply to create resources
# 2 - check the resources based on your assertions
# 3 - then run terraform destroy to remove the test resources and clean up

# example file is example.tftest.hcl
------------------------------------
variables {
  repo_name = "MyRepo"
}

run "e2e-test"{
  command = apply

  assert {
    condition     = aws_codecommit_repository.codecommit.repository_name == "MyRepo" # ðŸ‘ˆ here is where it's checking the repo name matches expected value
    error_message = "The CodeCommit Repo name didn't match the expected value."
  }
}

# in the above terraform apply and terraform destroy would be ran to test full functionality
# once code commit repo is created ...
# assertion will do a check based on the condition
# if true, test will pass, if fals test will fail and error message will be thrown

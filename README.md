# Terraform Workbench

This is my personal workspace for learning, testing, and building with Terraform.

It includes:
- Hands-on experiments with modules, variables, backends, providers, and more
- Reference patterns for real-world Terraform structure
- Mini-projects and end-to-end workflows
- Security, CI/CD, and testing integrations (e.g., Checkov, GitHub Actions)
